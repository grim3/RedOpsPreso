# What?
**Goal**: To arm you with enough knowledge to use Rust in your Red Team engagements and exercises. 

**RustOps Starterpack**: 
Obsidian notebook, slides and other workshop content will be made available after the presentation.

### Malware Fundamentals

* Malware is used to support the Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) life cycle.
	* Ideal operational CNE life cycle from *Network Attacks & Exploitation: A Framework* by [Matthew Monte](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119183440)

```

* [MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ¬†Matrix for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/#) The "Why" and "How" of CNE through documented real-world Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Note: 
* Start, Targeting, IA, Persistence, Access Expansion, Exfil, Detection, End
* Decoupling
* Common C2 frameworks
* Motives: Destruction, Sabotage, Financial gain
* As Red Teamers we want to test the Blue Team.

---
### Rust Terminology
* Crate
* Executable Crate
* Library Crate
* External Crate
* Packages
* Modules
* Cargo.toml
* Cargo.lock
* '.rs' Extension 
Notes:
- [ ] Cargo.toml is the manifest and config file 
- [ ] Cargo.lock is a record of all dependencies 
- [ ] Rust source file
---
### Cargo & Crates

* [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html): The Rust package manager 
* [RTFM](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html) (Yes, there is a book on Cargo.)
* [Crates.io](https://crates.io): The Rust community‚Äôs crate registry  

New project:
```cargo new {{project_name}}``` 

Create a new directory under the project:

`mdkir examples ; touch examples/demo.rs`

Run example:
`cargo run --example demo`

Build project:
`cargo build`

---
Run project within the directory :
`cargo run`


Generate HTML documentation from comments:

`cargo doc`

Alt. generate an executable from a single .rs file using the Rust compiler:

`rustc examples/demo.rs`

Notes:
- [ ] Note there are several flags under the run command
---
### Rust Project Structure
```bash
‚ùØ ls *
Cargo.lock      Cargo.toml
examples:
demo.rs
src:
main.rs
target:
CACHEDIR.TAG    debug
‚ùØ cargo run
    ... `removed for brevity`
Hello, world!
‚ùØ cargo run --example demo    
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.06s
     Running `target/debug/examples/demo`
Hello, from the example dir!
```
Notes:  
- [ ] Explain target debug
- [ ] Cargo.toml is the manifest and config file 
- [ ] Cargo.lock is a record of all dependencies 
- [ ] Rust source file

# Rust Basics

```rust
// <--crate imports
//entry point function
//`fn` denotes a function and the curly braces demarcates a function block. 
// V important concept for lifetimes
fn main() {
//`println!` is a macro. 
println!("Hello, from the example dir!");

let message = "Hello";
let name = "ü¶Ä";
println!("{:?}, {:?}",message,name);

}
```

Notes: 
- [ ] Macros provides the compatibility of a variadic function. 
- [ ] The `println!` macro prints to standard output and appends a linefeed to the formatted output.
- [ ] Check out the `asm!`
- [ ] The `:?` placeholder renders the dev view of the value. Great for debugging. 
	- [ ] Requires the debug trait `#[derive(Debug)]` over a struct, `println!` will pretty print the contents of the struct making it easier for the dev.
- [ ] There are format specifier as well. e.g., {:p} for a pointer address

### Important Concepts ü•≤

Closures, Collections, Control Flow, Enums, Functions, Generics, Macros, __Memory__, Modules, Patterns, Structures, Threads, Traits, Variables, __Lifetimes__, __Ownership__, __References__

[The Rust Book ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

Offline copy:
`rustup doc --book`

[The Rust Programming Language, 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition)

Notes:
- [ ] The ones in bold are imperative to understand.

### Native Windows APIs
Cargo.toml
```
[dependencies]
windows = { version = "0.58.0, features = ["Win32_Foundation","Win32_UI_Shell" "Win32_UI_WindowsAndMessaging"] }
```
main.rs
```rust
use windows::{core::*, Win32::UI::Shell::*, Win32::UI::WindowsAndMessaging::*};

fn main() {
	//No memory safety guarantees!
    unsafe {
        MessageBoxA(None, s!("Ansi"), s!("World"), MB_OK);
    }
}
```

[Rust for Windows, and the¬†_windows_crate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/rust-for-windows)

[MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messageboxa)

Notes:
- [ ] Note some Windows crates are safe
- [ ] Using unsafe function blocks unlocks super powers or control over raw pointers, access to other unsafe functions, traits, etc. 
- [ ] MSDN can be used to learn more about functions and how arguments should be implemented using Rust.

---
### Network Communication Channels

* HTTP/HTTPS
	* Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure, ...
	* Web services: Social Media Platforms
* DNS
* SMTP/IMAP
* FTP/SFTP
* P2P
* TOR
* TCP
* UDP
* ICMP

---
### HTTP/HTTPS

- Rust
	* minreq
	* reqwest
	* hyper
	* curl-rust

- Native
	* Windows Internet (WinINet)
	* WinHTTP

Notes:
- Mention Headers, hardcoded user agent, for fingerprinting and classifying malware
- Mention URL and API endpoints, e.g. 'api/update', 'api/v1/'
- Static config will result in trivial detection
---

GET
```rust
//import reqwest w/ "json" features
//import tokio with "full" features
//include main

let body = reqwest::get("http://httpbin.org/get")     
		.await?     
		.text()     
		.await?;  
println!("body = {body:?}");

```

POST
```rust

let client = reqwest::Client::new(); 
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")     
	.body("POST Malone")     
	.send()     
	.await?;
```

### Blue Team Challenges & Red Team Considerations

![image|500](https://tehtris.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image20.png)
Buer C2 URLs

* "Project 0xA11C" by Nicole Fishbein, Juan Andr√©s Guerrero-Saade (Presented at BlackHat 2024)
	* Methodology and tools for Rust malware RE

Notes: 
- Complexity: Rust does not have a stable Application Binary Interface (ABI)
	- Memory safe operations or anything that could cause the app to panic. 
- "A Rust developer can create a program without depending on the Rust standard library and only import system libraries as needed" BinaryDefense
- Strategy
- Detection points...

### Debugging Information

*There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.* 

‚Äï¬†Henry David Thoreau,¬†Walden, or Life in the Woods

Note: 
* I hope you found this useful and fun. 
* Why am I sharing this with you? 
	* I figured this would be a fun way to learn the language.
	* To gamify it
* Efforts to translate legacy code. DARPA - Project TRACTOR 
	* "The TRACTOR **program aims to automate the translation of legacy C code to Rust**. The goal is to achieve the same quality and style that a skilled Rust developer would produce, thereby eliminating the entire class of memory safety security vulnerabilities present in C programs. This program may involve novel combinations of software analysis, such as static analysis and dynamic analysis, and machine learning techniques like large language models."
